## Creating Responsive Web Page

### Project Description and its Functionality:

HTML page, styled by CSS, and Connected Third-Party Code including Fonts.  
The web page contains images, links, and grid layouts.


### Technologies Description and Used Techniques:

* Positioning elements using Flexbox.
* Positioning elements using Grid layoutsÂ and Grid Areas to create adaptive and responsive web-page which allow using different devices.
For Optimizing responsiveness I used Media Queries, The Fr Unit, Meta Tags, the calc() Function
* Optimizing exported images using [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) and [svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) To Maximize the fast of the loading.
* I was practicing command-line-using to create the files structure and upload the project to git by creating and merging branches.
* I organized all the files according to BEM structure using the @import Rule, and Connected the Necessary Blocks to the Web Page, to achieve maximum Code mobility.
* I used the chrome dev-tools for Debugging.
* I used Figma for guidelines:
